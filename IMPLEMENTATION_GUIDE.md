# Implementation Guide for Organized Crime-Fighting Simulation

This guide provides recommendations for implementing the remaining components of the simulation.

## Current Status

The project structure is set up with:
- Basic file skeletons for all components
- Header files with essential data structures
- Basic implementation of utility functions
- Configuration handling
- IPC mechanisms
- Visualization framework
- Makefile for building

## Next Steps

Follow these steps to complete the implementation:

## 1. Core Components Implementation

### Gang Module
- Complete `gang_member_routine()` to simulate member behavior
- Enhance `plan_new_mission()` with more complex planning logic
- Improve the `investigate_for_agents()` method to make it more realistic
- Implement promotion mechanism for gang members
- Add functionality for spreading false information among lower ranks

### Police Module
- Complete `process_intelligence()` to analyze reports from multiple agents
- Enhance `decide_on_action()` with more sophisticated decision logic
- Implement `police_routine()` to actively monitor gang activities
- Add mechanisms to track discovered and executed agents

### IPC and Synchronization
- Test message passing between secret agents and police
- Ensure shared memory is properly synchronized using semaphores
- Implement notification system for police actions

## 2. Testing Individual Components

Before integrating everything:
1. Test gang processes in isolation
2. Test police process in isolation
3. Test IPC mechanisms between processes
4. Test visualization with mock data

## 3. Integration and Synchronization

Once individual components work:
1. Integrate gang and police processes
2. Ensure proper synchronization of shared data
3. Connect visualization to live simulation data
4. Test termination conditions

## 4. Simulation Refinement

Enhance realism and complexity:
1. Implement variable preparation times based on crime type
2. Add more sophisticated agent detection algorithms
3. Improve police decision making based on multiple reports
4. Add visualization enhancements to show mission status
5. Implement gang member promotion system

## 5. Performance Optimization

1. Minimize unnecessary CPU usage (use condition variables)
2. Optimize shared memory access patterns
3. Reduce synchronization overhead where possible
4. Profile the application to identify bottlenecks

## 6. Debugging Tips

- Use printf debugging with timestamps to track process/thread execution
- Leverage GDB for debugging:
  ```
  gcc -g src/*.c -I include -o build/crime_sim -pthread -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lm
  gdb ./build/crime_sim
  ```
- Create a debug mode with extra logging
- Use `valgrind` to check for memory leaks:
  ```
  valgrind --leak-check=full ./build/crime_sim config/simulation_config.txt
  ```

## 7. Graphics Enhancements

After basic functionality works:
1. Add animations for missions
2. Visualize preparation levels
3. Show agent information flow
4. Add visual indicators for prison status
5. Display gang hierarchies

## Implementation Strategy

It's recommended to follow an incremental approach:
1. First make it work without graphics
2. Then add minimal graphics
3. Finally enhance graphics and add animations

## Priority of Implementation

1. Core simulation logic (gangs, members, and police)
2. Inter-process communication
3. Multi-threading behavior
4. Visualization
5. Enhancements and optimizations

Remember to regularly commit your code to track progress and maintain backups.
