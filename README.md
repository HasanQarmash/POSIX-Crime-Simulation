```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The simulation behavior is controlled through `config/simulation_config.txt`:

### Gang Configuration
```ini
MIN_GANGS=2                    # Minimum number of gangs
MAX_GANGS=4                    # Maximum number of gangs
MIN_MEMBERS_PER_GANG=2         # Minimum gang size
MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GANG=3         # Maximum gang size
GANG_RANKS=7                   # Number of hierarchy levels
```

### Crime Planning
```ini
PREPARATION_TIME_MIN=5         # Minimum preparation time
PREPARATION_TIME_MAX=10        # Maximum preparation time
MIN_PREPARATION_LEVEL=30       # Minimum prep level required
MAX_PREPARATION_LEVEL=90       # Maximum prep level achievable
FALSE_INFO_PROBABILITY=30      # Chance of spreading disinformation
```

### Secret Agents
```ini
AGENT_INFILTRATION_SUCCESS_RATE=30  # Agent placement probability
AGENT_SUSPICION_THRESHOLD=85        # Discovery risk threshold
POLICE_ACTION_THRESHOLD=80          # Action decision threshold
```

### Termination Conditions
```ini
MAX_THWARTED_PLANS=100         # Max police successes
MAX_SUCCESSFUL_PLANS=100       # Max gang successes

## üìä Simulation Flow

1. **Initialization**: Gangs and police processes are created with configured parameters
2. **Mission Planning**: Gang leaders select crime types and set preparation requirements
3. **Preparation Phase**: Gang members work to reach required preparation levels
4. **Intelligence Gathering**: Secret agents collect information and report to police
5. **Police Analysis**: Intelligence reports are processed and action decisions made
6. **Mission Execution**: Gangs attempt crimes while police may intervene
7. **Consequences**: Successful missions, arrests, or agent discoveries occur
8. **Cycle Repeat**: New missions are planned and the cycle continues

# Install missing dependencies
sudo apt-get install build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev

# Check GCC version
gcc --version  # Should be 4.9+
```

**Simulation hangs?**
```bash
# Enable debug mode
make debug
gdb ./build/crime_sim
```
